# Proposal: Maritime Disruption Project

The global maritime transportation network is a critical backbone of international trade, yet its interconnected nature makes it highly vulnerable to cascading disruptions. This project aims to tackle the research question: "How do localized disruptions at major global ports propagate through the maritime port network, and which targeted resilience investments or mitigations most effectively reduce network-wide impacts?" By answering this question, we strive to create a reproducible, data-driven framework that models the propagation of disruptions and highlights optimal interventions to mitigate systemic risks.

We plan to build an end-to-end pipeline that integrates data preprocessing, predictive machine-learning modeling, cascade simulations, and resilience investment optimization. The pipeline will preprocess and harmonize multi-source port-related datasets into a unified port-year analytical panel. Predictive models, including temporal baselines and advanced classifiers (e.g., gradient boosting, tree ensembles, neural networks), will estimate disruption probabilities at each port, leveraging features such as historical disruptions, centrality metrics, trade volumes, and geographic attributes. To investigate disruption propagation, we will develop a cascade simulator that introduces synthetic, localized shocks at key ports and models their propagation to neighboring ports using a configurable propagation kernel. This simulation will help quantify system-level impacts in terms of intensity (total risk increase) and distance (network spread).

The data for this study will include maritime activity records from the UN/LOCODE port registry, IMF port and chokepoint datasets, connectivity indices from UNCTAD, World Bank container traffic data, and curated disruption event records. The scope will cover approximately 2,000 ports and span decades, creating a robust dataset of over 70,000 port-year observations. Data quality will be ensured through structured ingestion pipelines, imputation strategies for missing values, outlier handling, and feature engineering.

The ultimate deliverable will address both predictive and prescriptive components. The predictive models will provide granular insights into which ports are most vulnerable to cascading disruptions, while the prescriptive analyses will use Economic Value of Resilience (EVR) frameworks to propose targeted investments in port infrastructure or policy measures. This approach allows us to prioritize interventions based on both system-wide risk reduction and return on investment, calibrated through Monte Carlo simulations for better uncertainty quantification.

By creating a transparent, reproducible tool to decode maritime network vulnerabilities and prescribe resilience strategies, this work contributes to both the academic understanding of complex global port networks and actionable decision-making in the maritime logistics domain. Informed by network science, machine learning, and systems optimization, the project aims to bridge the gap between theoretical frameworks and practical resilience engineering for one of the world’s most critical trade networks.
